## Software Development Life Cycle 
- Systematic process to develop high quality software

1. Improves Efficiency and reduces risk
2. Team members know that they should be working on and when
3. Improved Communication between developers and stake holders
4. Provides room for iteration

## Six Phases
Distinct phases
1. Planning
	1. Purpose 
	2. QA
	3. Projects Teams
	4. Requirements
	5. Prototyping
	6. Software Requirement Specification
2. Design
	1. Designing the architecture
	2. more prototyping
	3. document software needs
3. Develop
	1. Design Document implemented
	2. assignments made
	3. writing the code 
4. Testing Phase
	1. Bugs reported and fixed
	2. Unit testing
5. Deployment
	1. Prepare Production Enviroment
	2. Tested Code is released into production
6. Maintenance
	1. Other Bugs
	2. Code Enhancement
	3. User Interface Changes
